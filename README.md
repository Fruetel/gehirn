# Gehirn 🧠

Welcome to Gehirn, an experiment where I'm reimagining artificial intelligence by mimicking the complexities and functionalities of the human brain. Gehirn, meaning 'brain' in German, represents my vision to create a network of AI agents, each acting as a distinct part of a brain, working in unison to simulate human-like cognitive processes.

## Project Status 🚧

**Current Phase:** Early Stages 🌱

Gehirn is in its infancy, but I'm excited about the journey ahead.

## Vision 🌌

The goal is to develop a system of interconnected AI agents, each powered initially by a single instance of OpenHermes-2.5-Mistral. These agents, akin to different brain areas, will have unique responsibilities and capabilities. They will communicate and collaborate, forming an intricate web of 'thoughts' and 'decisions' that mirror human cognitive functions.

### Long-Term Aspirations 🚀

- **Specialized Agents**: Evolve from a single model instance to using specialized remote model endpoints, enhancing the capabilities of each 'brain area'.
- **Dynamic Learning and Adaptation**: Implement feedback loops allowing agents to learn and adapt, much like the human brain.
- **Consciousness and Self Awareness**: Who knows what a Gehirn is capable of?

## How It Works 🛠️

- **Agent Design**: Each agent is uniquely crafted with specialized prompts to fulfill distinct cognitive roles.
- **Communication Protocol**: A sophisticated protocol enables efficient and contextual information exchange between agents.
- **Scalability**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for integration of more complex and specialized models over time.
